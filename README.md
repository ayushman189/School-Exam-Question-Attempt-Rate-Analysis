# School Exam Question Attempt Rate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes question-wise attempt rates of students in a school examination.
The goal is to identify the difficulty level of questions based on how many students attempted them.

This is a Statistics Minor Semester Project implemented using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 🎯Objectives
- To calculate question-wise attempt rate (%)
- To perform mean analysis
- To visualize data using bar charts
- To classify questions into Easy, Medium, and Hard
- To help teachers improve question paper quality
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 🗂 Dataset Description
- Each row represents a **question**
- Columns include:
  - Question number
  - Number of students who attempted the question
  - Total number of students
- The dataset is sample data created for analysis purposes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


🛠 Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

📐 Methodology
1. Created a Pandas DataFrame with question-wise data
2. Calculated attempt rate percentage for each question
3. Computed mean attempt rate
4. Classified questions based on difficulty level
5. Visualized attempt rates using a bar chart

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


✅Conclusion
Questions with lower attempt rates were classified as harder.
This analysis helps understand student behavior and can assist teachers in designing balanced question papers.
